Movie Genre Recognition
Overview
This project aims to automatically recognize the genre of a movie based on its poster image using machine learning techniques. Movie genre recognition has numerous applications in the film industry, including recommendation systems, content tagging, and marketing strategies.

Approach
We employ deep learning techniques to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) capable of recognizing movie genres from poster images. The steps involved in the project include:

Data Collection: Gathering a diverse set of movie poster images along with their genre labels.
Data Preprocessing: Resizing, normalizing, and augmenting the poster images to improve model generalization.
Model Architecture: Designing a CNN architecture suitable for image classification tasks, possibly leveraging pre-trained models like VGG, ResNet, or Inception.
Model Training: Training the CNN on the labeled poster images, optimizing its parameters using backpropagation and gradient descent.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the trained model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on a separate validation set.
Fine-tuning: Fine-tuning the model and hyperparameters to improve its performance further.
Deployment: Deploying the trained model in a production environment for genre recognition of new movie posters.
